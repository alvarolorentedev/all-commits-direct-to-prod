# Attitude

### You Build it you Run it

Create DevOps Culture. Not a Dev vs Ops.

{{% note %}}
Mention Normally Devs are ask for delivery speed and stability
Devops culture is based on colaboration on runing everything as a team of developers that at the same time observe operations.

### [Broken Window] vs [Boy scout]

Don't continue the same path if you think something can be done better.

{{% note %}}
If you see code that can be done better, or some practices that can help delivery dont shy away because you are currently not doing it, or wait for other to move the ball.

# Observability

<img src="/images/no_alarms.png" width="700"/>

--- 

### Alarms

- Be lazy
- Get notified when something happens
- Ex. Datadog + Pager Duty

--- 

### Metrics Dashboards

- Visualization
- Ex. Datadog

--- 

### Metrics Dashboards
[Details] VS [Status]

{{% note %}}
It is easy to spot where the problem is. Because we don't enter a cognitive overload state.

### Logs

- To go in depth in issues.
- Do not log everything.
- Ex. Kibana

{{% note %}}
You want to dig into issues logging everything will just cause you a headache trying to find the logs you are really interested on.
