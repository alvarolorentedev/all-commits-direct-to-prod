Devops culture is based on colaboration on runing everything as a team of developers that at the same time observe operations.

# Observability

### Alarms

- Be lazy
- Get notified when something happens
- Ex. Datadog + Pager Duty

### Metrics Dashboards

- Visualization
- Ex. Datadog

### Metrics Dashboards
[Details] VS [Status]

### Logs

- To go in depth in issues.
- Do not log everything.
- Ex. Kibana

游릭 MTTR

You want to dig into issues logging everything will just cause you a headache trying to find the logs you are really interested on.
